# RightOmicsTools

This package is a set of tools to facilitate the analysis of single-cell
RNA-seq data in R. It is currently in development and will be updated
regularly with new functions and improvements.

## Quick start

You can get started with `RightOmicsTools` by following the [tutorial
vignette](https://alexis-varin.github.io/RightOmicsTools/articles/RightOmicsTools.html)
which will guide you through package installation as well as showing
some examples of the functions available.

## Vignettes

This package also contains three other vignettes, currently under
construction, one deep diving into [advanced customization of
visualization
functions](https://alexis-varin.github.io/RightOmicsTools/articles/Visualization.html),
another one demonstrating how to [create and visualize gene signatures
from GSEA
pathways](https://alexis-varin.github.io/RightOmicsTools/articles/GSEA.html),
and finally a last one showing helper functions designed to [facilitate
differential gene expression in pseudotime analysis with the tradeSeq
package](https://alexis-varin.github.io/RightOmicsTools/articles/tradeSeq.html),
with a focus on a heatmap visualization function of gene expression
along pseudotime, an often requested feature.

## Reference

All functions are [documented on
GitHub](https://alexis-varin.github.io/RightOmicsTools/reference/index.html)
and help may also be accessed using `?` in R.
