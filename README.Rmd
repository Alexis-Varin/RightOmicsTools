This package is a set of tools to facilitate the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data in R. It is currently in development and will be updated regularly with new functions and improvements.

## Quick start

You can get started with `RightOmicsTools` by following the [tutorial vignette](https://alexis-varin.github.io/RightOmicsTools/articles/RightOmicsTools.html) which will guide you through package installation as well as showing some examples of the functions available.

## Vignettes

The package also contains two other vignettes, currently under construction, one deep diving into [advanced customization of visualization functions](https://alexis-varin.github.io/RightOmicsTools/articles/Visualization.html) and another one demonstrating how to [create and visualize gene signatures from GSEA pathways](https://alexis-varin.github.io/RightOmicsTools/articles/GSEA.html).

## Reference

All functions are [documented on GitHub](https://alexis-varin.github.io/RightOmicsTools/reference/index.html) and help may also be accessed using `?` in R.

## Citation

Finally, if you would like to cite this package, you will find all information [here](https://alexis-varin.github.io/RightOmicsTools/authors.html).
